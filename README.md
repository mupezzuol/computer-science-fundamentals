# Computer Science Fundamentals  

This repository is a collection of notes, diagrams, and explanations about the core concepts of Computer Science.  
It includes topics such as operating systems, networking (OSI model), programming principles, data structures, algorithms, and more.

The goal is to provide a clear and visual reference, using **README** for structured explanations and **Excalidraw** for diagrams.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo is meant to serve as:
- A **study guide** for learners and professionals  
- A **visual reference** with diagrams and examples  
- A **living document** that grows with new insights and topics  

## 🗂 Topics Explained & Links
Each major topic will have its own folder in the repository, containing notes, diagrams, and examples:

- [📡 Networking](./networking) – OSI Model, TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, etc.
- [👨🏼‍💻 Data Structures & Algorithms](./data-structures-algorithms/) – Big O Notation, time/space complecity, data structures, etc.
- [⚙️ Software Engineering]() – Principles, methodologies, design patterns.`(pending...)`

## 📚 Topics (to be expanded)
- Operating Systems (processes, threads, memory management)
- Programming Concepts (OOP, functional programming, paradigms)
- Databases (relational, NoSQL, transactions)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) – for diagrams and visual aids
